# COSMIC Data Fusion Platform

## Project Overview
COSMIC Data Fusion is an intelligent astronomical data platform designed to unify disparate data sources (FITS, HDF5, CSV) into a single, standardized reality. It provides AI-powered anomaly detection, predictive data completion, and real-time collaboration tools for professional astronomers and researchers.

## Real-Time Collaboration
The platform supports multi-user sessions with live cursor tracking and presence indicators.

### Demo Credentials
To test the collaboration features, open the application in multiple tabs or windows and sign in with these accounts:

| Role | Username | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Expedition Lead** | `Commander_Cosmo` | `any_password` |
| **Data Analyst** | `Star_Observer` | `any_password` |

*Note: In the current preview mode, any username/password combination will work.*

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Ingestion**: Support for FITS, HDF5, and CSV.
- **Unified Schema**: Automatically standardizes physical units and coordinate systems.
- **AI Engine**: Performs automated anomaly detection (supernovae, variable stars) and spatial clustering.
- **Predictive Completion**: Uses KNN and linear interpolation to heal data gaps.
- **3D Visualization**: immersive galaxy background and 3D UI elements.
